# Hercules LAUNCHXL2-RM46L852-BitFlipDetector


## Project description
The Hercules LAUNCHXL2-RM46L852-BitFlipDetector project aims to detect Single Event Upset (SEU) i.e. bit flips that might occur in the CPU operations and RAM within the Hercules RM46L852 microcontroller.The project is divided into two parts: (a)Monitoring of CPU operations using built-in lockstep mode and (b) Assigning a custom region in the RAM and filling it with Pseudo-Random Binary Sequence (PRBS-7) data and continuously verifying its checksum to detect bit flips.

In the first part, we use the built-in lockstep mode of the Hercules microcontroller to continuously compare the bus outputs of two CPU cores(Master Cortex-R4F CPU and Checker Cortex-R4F CPU) running in parallel and in case of signal mismatch which might occur due to bit flips, the CPU Compare Module for Cortex-R4F (CCM-R4F) signals an error to ESM(Error Signaling module).Our code checks the status register of the lockstep mode continuously in a loop and logs the status over serial communication along with specified LED blinking.In case of signal mismatch,it blinks the dedicated error LED to indicate the error and logs the mismatch over the serial communication.

In the second part of the project where we check for bitflips in the RAM of the Hercules microcontroller, we divided the RAM regions into two sections named custom_data_section and data_store_section and were defined in the linker script.Defined custom data section region is used for initializing the RAM with data generated using PRBS-7 and data store section region is used to store a copy of the generated PRBS-7 data used to fill the custom data section.Along with this, we also calculate the expected checksum while filling the custom data section with PRBS-7 data.Later in the continuous loop, we check if the calculated checksum matches our expected checksum or not and also we compare the custom data section with data store section to check for bitflips, count them, log them and correct the bit flips and continue the cycle to detect more bitflips. The loop continuously checks if the calculated checksum matches with the expected checksum and if the bitflip count is greater than 0. If there is checksum mismatch and bit flip count is non-zero, it notifies the user over serial communication about the mismatch and also indicates about the bit flip via assigned error LED blinking.

The ultimate goal of this project is to test the microcontroller chip against radiation-induced Single Event Effects (SEEs) by simulating space conditions using a particle accelerator.The data collected during the experiment will be used to determine the SEE cross section of the chip which is extremely important for predicting the reliability of the chip.The project aims to publish these findings which will provide valuable insights into the microcontrollerâ€™s reliability in harsh environments like space contributing to future space missions. 


## Folder and File Descriptions

The project is organized into below mentioned files,each serving a specific purpose in the detection and logging of bit flips and CPU errors caused by Single Event Effects (SEEs). Below is the description of each file and its functionality:

### CPU Compare Module(Lockstep Mode)_Bitflip-detector
- **File**: `sys_main.c`
- **Description**:
  - It is the main application for monitoring the lockstep mode of the CCM-R4F (CPU Compare Module) in the Hercules RM46L852 microcontroller.
  - The application continuously checks the CCM Status Register's 16th bit using a bitwise AND operation for compare errors, which notifies about errors incase there is mismatch between the outputs of two CPU cores running in lockstep mode.
  - Errors are then logged via SCI(Serial Communication Interface) and indicated by LED status, providing real-time monitoring of the CPU in harsh environments.
  - This setup helps us to know how reliable Hercules CPU is even when exposed to cosmic radiation or other sources of SEEs.

### Memory(RAM)_Bitflip-detector
- **File**: `sys_main.c`
- **Description**:
  - It is the main application for detecting bit flips in a custom-defined RAM region of the Hercules RM46L852 microcontroller. 
  - The application uses a Pseudo-Random Binary Sequence (PRBS-7) to initialize the custom defined RAM regionand continuously calculates a checksum and matches it with expected checksum to detect bit flips.
  - If a bit flip is detected, the event is logged over the Serial Communication Interface (SCI),error LED indicator is toggled to signal the error and finally the flipped bit is corrected.
  - The application is designed for radiation testing, where the reliability of the memory(RAM) is tested against SEEs during particle irradiation.

### Serial_Monitor(Log script)
- **File**: `main.py`
- **Description**:
  - This Python script was developed so that the user can see the bitflip or status messages from Hercules microcontroller via UART.
  - It continuously listens for messages from the microcontroller via assigned COM port, displays the messages in the terminal and finally logs the messages with a timestamp into a text file (`bitflip_log.txt`).
  - The script is required for capturing real-time data during testing i.e. detection of bit flips, which is critical for determining the SEE cross section of the chip.
  - The script helps the user to monitor the microcontroller's outputs during irradiation tests.
